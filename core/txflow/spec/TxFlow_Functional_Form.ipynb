    "# TxFlow Functional Form\n",
    "\n",
    "TxFlow algorithm is all about building a DAG of messages and recognizing when a certain message has some special properties. The properties of each message depend exclusively on its sub-DAG. We constantly iterate on the improvements of the algorithm in several languages that use different algorithmic approaches, e.g. Rust implementation tries to avoid DAG traversals by precomputing the needed information in each message, while Javascript aims for the simplicity of the implementation. While we do these iterations it easy to lose track of the actual algorithm in the implementation details. This notebook lists the predicates that formally define the properties of the messages and serves as the **source of truth** for TxFlow."
